                At Magniflex, we're dedicated to ensuring you enjoy the ultimate
                sleep comfort. If, for any reason, you find yourself
                dissatisfied with your Magniflex product purchased directly from
                our website, please do not hesitate to contact us at
                1-888-381-8481 or via email at info@magniflex.us. If your
                purchase was made through an authorized Magniflex retailer, we
                kindly request that you get in touch with them directly. It's
                important to note that certain fees, including those associated
                with in-home delivery, setup, shipping, and disposables, are
                non-refundable. When processing a return, please be aware that

                Trial for every Magniflex mattress bought directly from our
                website. We recommend allowing your new mattress a minimum of 30
                nights for proper acclimatization before considering a return.
                To be eligible for a return, you must still be within your
                90-Night Sleep Trial, with at least 30 days of use, and your
                mattress should remain in pristine condition, free of damage,
                and used with a suitable mattress protector. Thank you for
                choosing Magniflex to enhance your sleep experience. Your
