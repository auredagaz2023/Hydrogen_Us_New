                In consideration of the type of goods offered / advertised

                and information collected for a maximum time of 20 years, as

                How we use cookies <br />
                <br />
                A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on
                your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added
                and the cookies help analyze web traffic or information when you
                visit a page on a particular site. Cookies allow web
                applications to respond to you as an individual. The web
                application can do this based on your needs, likes and dislikes
                by collecting and remembering information about your
                preferences. <br />
                <br />
                We use cookie log traffic to identify which pages have been
                used. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic and
                improve our website so that we can tailor it to user needs. We
                only use information for statistical analysis and then remove it
                from the system. <br />
                <br />
                Cookies help us to offer you a better experience on our website,
                by allowing us to monitor which pages you find most useful and
                which you don't. A cookie in no way gives us access to your
                computer or any information about you, other than the data you
                share with us. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most
                browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually
                modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
                This may prevent you from making the most of the website. <br />
