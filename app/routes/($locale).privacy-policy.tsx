                The Italian Data Protection Authority considers session,
                functionality, and (only in certain specific conditions)
                analytics cookies as technical cookies. In particular, the
                Authority, with the document “Cookie Guidelines and Other
                Tracking Instruments” of June 10, 2021, has specified that the
                latter can be likened to technical cookies only if: <br />
                <br />
                - they are used only to produce aggregate statistics and in
                relation to a single website or a single mobile app; <br />
                <br />
                - the fourth component of the IP address is masked, at least
                those of third parties; <br />
                <br />
                - third parties abstain from combining analytics cookies,
                minimized in this manner, with other computed data or from
                sending them to other third parties (however, it is permitted to
                third parties to produce statistics with data relating to
                multiple domains, websites, or apps that can be traced back to
                the same publisher or business group). <br />
                <br />
                The Data Controller that directly produces only statistics on
                data relating to multiple domains, websites, or apps that are
                traceable to it may also use the data in unencrypted form, in
                compliance with the constraint of purpose. <br />
